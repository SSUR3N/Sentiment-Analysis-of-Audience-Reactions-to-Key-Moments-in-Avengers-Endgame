# Week 4 Report: Sentiment Analysis using Hugging Face Transformers 

What is Hugging Face Transformers 

Hugging Face Transformers is an open-source Python library that provides access to thousands of pre-trained Transformers models for natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, audio tasks, and more.

What is the Hugging Face Hub?
The Hugging Face Hub is a collaboration platform that hosts a huge collection of open-source models and datasets for machine learning, think of it being like Github for ML. The hub facilitates sharing and collaborating by making it easy for you to discover, learn, and interact with useful ML assets from the open-source community. The hub integrates with, and is used in conjunction with the Transformers library, as models deployed using the Transformers library are downloaded from the hub.

What are Hugging Face Spaces?
Spaces from Hugging Face is a service available on the Hugging Face Hub that provides an easy to use GUI for building and deploying web hosted ML demos and apps. The service allows you to quickly build ML demos, upload your own apps to be hosted, or even select a number of pre-configured ML applications to deploy instantly.


ü§ó Transformers provides APIs and tools to easily download and train state-of-the-art pretrained models. Using pretrained models can reduce your compute costs, carbon footprint, and save you the time and resources required to train a model from scratch. These models support common tasks in different modalities, such as:

üìù Natural Language Processing: text classification, named entity recognition, question answering, language modeling, code generation, summarization, translation, multiple choice, and text generation.
üñºÔ∏è Computer Vision: image classification, object detection, and segmentation.
üó£Ô∏è Audio: automatic speech recognition and audio classification.
üêô Multimodal: table question answering, optical character recognition, information extraction from scanned documents, video classification, and visual question answering.

ü§ó Transformers support framework interoperability between PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX. This provides the flexibility to use a different framework at each stage of a model‚Äôs life; train a model in three lines of code in one framework, and load it for inference in another. Models can also be exported to a format like ONNX and TorchScript for deployment in production environments.
