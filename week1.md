The topic that I have chosen for sentiment analysis is: "Sentiment Analysis of Audience Reactions at Key Moments in Avengers: Endgame." Again, the subject is very interesting but at the same time extremely relevant for understanding the emotional investment of the audience in major movie events. By focusing our attention on the audience emotions which are expressed through social media, we will manage to find emotional involvement trends, thus learning from that what works for an audience.

This would allow investigation into how these positive, negative, and neutral sentiments fall into place at different junctures in the movie.

Why this topic is fun
"Avengers: Endgame" is really a representative work in modern movies, pouring ten years of developing storyline into one peak. Reliving these scenes together with the audience's reactions really feels like re-living those moments of thrill, tension, and emotion all over again.
It also helps in exploring how those scenes made a person cry, laugh, and disappointing, hence making the entire process nostalgically meaningful.
Significance of the Research
The following sentiment analysis can be of great use for filmmakers and analysts of the entertainment industry. By understanding what precisely provokes the most vivid emotions, movie creators can:

Create more dramatic and unforgettable scenes.
Enhance narrative elements which strike a chord with viewers. Future projects should balance action, drama, and emotional depth to hold the attention of an audience.

Ultimately, this study could contribute to creating movies that aren’t just entertaining but also deeply impactful, leaving a lasting impression on moviegoers. I believe this project is not only fun and engaging but also offers a practical application in shaping the future of cinema. I’m excited to get the dataset reviewed and approved to move forward with the analysis!
