# Week 4 Report: Sentiment Analysis using NLTK, TextBlob and VADER

Viewed various libraries this week for sentiment analysis, which include NLTK, TextBlob, and VADER. Each of them had the big idea of studying text data in order to find out whether the sentiments of the text were positive, negative, or neutral.

# 1. Introduction to NLTK
The week gave an introduction to NLTK, a very powerful library used to operate and analyze natural language text. We learned some of the key techniques like

Tokenization means breaking text into single words or sentences using word_tokenize().
Stopword removal: Common words like "the" and "is" which do not carry much meaning in the text are eliminated.
Lemmatization and stemming reduce words to basic forms so that analysis is made easier.

Important Steps:
- I prepared the text data by:
- Noise and special character removal.
- converting text to lowercase.
- Tokenization and stop word removal.
